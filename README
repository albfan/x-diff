Running X-Diff
--------------

java XDiff [-o|-g] [-p percent] xml_file1 xml_file2 result_file

or,

xdiff [-o|-g] [-p percent] xml_file1 xml_file2 result_file

Options:

	The default mode is "-o -p 0.3".
	
  -o	The optimal mode, to get the diff result with minimum editing
  	distance.
	
  -g	The greedy mode, to get a diff result quickly, the result may not
